# iws

This is a feature request application that enables users to post new features they
would like to see implemented on the site. The application begins with loading the tabular
data within a sortable table. By the way this application interacts with an api
which is hosted separately. New features can be added by selecting the "New Feature"
button, which will display a "New Feature" form modal. On submit of this form you will
see your newly list feature appear within the table.
